<h3>Personal Information</h3>
    
    ![](MyFace.png)
    
    <p style="border:2px solid Violet;">I’m Alisa. I was born in Russia on an island no one has ever heard of~ Sakhalin. Soon after my family immigrated to Australia to later earn citizenship. My mum named me after having a dream related to ‘Alice in Wonderland’ the day before I was born. The pronunciation of my name translates to Alice in russian and so does the spelling, but I was still named Alisa. I’m also able to speak and understand russian, but sadly not write or read. My family once again moved overseas for a few years where we traveled all around Europe, finally returning back to Australia for good. We moved houses often and funnily enough, two times on the same street. I’ve just recently graduated from high school and am currently completing a Bachelor in IT. An interesting fact about me is that I took apart an old computer just to use some parts for a small sculpture because I like art very much. I guess I’m just making up for the disrespect I caused towards a computer by immersing myself in the world of IT.</p>
    
    <h3>Intrest in IT</h3>
    
    <p style="border:2px solid LightPink;">I became interested in IT ever since I bought my first computer in grade 6. I was amazed at how such a small machine has been made the way it is and still curious of how everything works as much as the mysteries of life and death. I’ve always liked to go onto command prompt, change the colour to green and then type ‘tree’ to look like I was coding or hacking. During high school I also became interested in robotics as I had an opportunity to attend an IT/Engineering seminar to build it and code my own robot.

I chose RMIT because it had a more hands on experience compared to other universities that focus on more academic aspects. I feel that I would be able to learn more efficiently and be able to maintain my skill in choosing RMIT. As well as the course itself, it’s located in a great environment with transport accessibility, many great people and food. The abbreviation of RMIT also contains ‘institute of technology’ in its name so that should say enough about studying IT at RMIT.

During my studies I expect to learn multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, SQL, html, CSS etc, enough to be able to utilise in my future jobs to a sufficient level. I also expect to learn better team work skills and even a bit of leadership throughout group projects to better be able to work efficiently as well as effectively in a team. I also hope to learn enough to be able to write some programs for the robot I assembled so it could finally function how I want it too.

    <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
    <p style="border:2px solid HotPink;">The job advertisement:<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51852366?type=standard#searchRequestToken=cae8c542-63ef-4193-a81c-3224913af949">Software Developer SEEK</a> Position description and appeal: A software developer assists in creating, developing and testing software throughout the whole process. This job is appealing to me as I’m able to see the production of the whole software through and be able to manage it with my own ideas as well as the clients. I wouldn't be satisfied if I chose a job to manage a part of the production as I like to be able to complete and finalize projects /ideas. For example only being a part of the coding parts as a programmer would make me feel like I quite literally haven't ‘finished’ the job. 		 

Skills, qualifications and experience needed: The skills needed are being able to understand and program in multiple different programming languages such as Python, CSS, Java etc. 
The qualifications needed are preferably bachelor of Computer Science or any other that are relevant to the field. There usually is experience that is required to be able to get into the job of previous similar jobs working as a developer. 

Current skills, qualifications and experience needed: Currently I’m on track to completing a bachelor of IT and know basic coding of Python and html. I have no experience either as I have just started my studies in this field. 

Plan for improvement: To obtain the skills needed I need to continue studying in my field and possibly complete a bachelor of computer science if my current degree isn't enough. I also need to often practice coding during my own time to be able to improve my understanding of these languages. I may also have to apply for internships or junior positions to even qualify for some experience as it’s very difficult to gain first hand straight out of uni as companies may be more reluctant to accept freshly graduated students to be software developers for their company.

    <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
    
    <p style="border:2px solid LightPink;"> The results of these tests imply that I prefer to be more hands on and be there with my team physically to be able to learn from and improve on our ideas as well as communicate clearly to be able to organize things for us to reach the goal. However my introverted nature also means I do prefer working alone sometimes. My reserved character means I also prefer listening to others' ideas and expanding from there rather than mine, however if we are all introverts, quiet and reserved then I’m usually the one to take charge as I don’t like to sit still too long. Taking into account my personality I believe it would be to have a good mix of introverts and extraverts for some members to be understanding of needing some space as well as extraverts who’ll be able to push us to work together more efficiently. 

Also being more on the feeling (INFJ-T) and agreeableness (Big5) side I feel like I’d be able to encourage and offer support to my team through rough patches. Where my more consciencessness (Big5) and judging (INFJ-T) side will offer my dependableness and hardworking side to reassure my members that I’ll trustfully get the job done no matter what. I get stressed pretty easily so it’ll be reassuring for me to know that I can also depend on others. Though my personality is a little contradicting to how I get things done, I can make it work, especially if a team depends on me :)

    <h3>Project Idea</h3>
    
    <p>Overview: I’m interested in developing a project idea of an app which feels like a personal stylist in your pocket. The app uses an algorithm to create a combination of outfits to wear by using images straight from peoples closets by providing a photo of their t-shirts, shoes, accessories etc, from their camera roll or camera to the app. There will be specific styles/aesthetics/occasions/tags you can input into the app to create a fit for you by recognising certain features and colours from the images of your own uploads (the clothes), and matching it with the associated keywords/ you inputted. This will finally create an output of a column of images from head to toe </p>
    
    <p> Motivation: This project may be lightly useful for people who struggle to decide what to wear and spend a good 20 minutes searching for something right and suitable to wear out/in. Appearance may bring confidence to others who are struggling with assurance towards themselves. Therefore by having a system that specifically tackles that problem, may reduce the anxiety of not finding the right thing to wear, the time it takes to choose and the lack of confidence if you don't feel comfortable with what you're wearing. It's also interesting as it may bring about new combinations you haven't thought of yourself and just having fun with the app itself. </p>
    
    <p> Description: Initially the app loads you into the service in which the user may customize their profile and enter in details regarding the styles they are interested in (e.g selecting tags like casual, gothic, cute, street) and makes it the default keyword when generating outfit combinations. However obviously each time you generate a fit you can select different keywords to fit the occasion, the initial tags are just for efficiency and convenience. Within the app you can select multiple photos from the photo library of any clothes/accessories/shoes you take a photo of or find images of and load it into the app's database/own library. The more imagery you select the greater the variety of custom fits. When loading in images from your photo library the system may detect similar/the same clothes that they have found a professional/cleaner image (with white background or from a store image) of and asks if the user would like to replace it for an improved experience. </p>
    
    <p> You are then taken into the ‘styling’ screen where you select tags if needed and input such as- weather (the current weather will already be loaded in with location permissions on), colours, if you want to style with a certain piece of clothing etc, that you want each for each generated fit. You can then initialize the process where a small panel (a page like setting, however app friendly) is created of columns of different pieces of clothing from head to toe that is complimented together with users needs. A description of the imputed related details will also be presented on the panel. There is a button in which the user can constantly press to continue generating more pieces until one that interests them or they can select/unselect one-multiple pieces of clothing the user would like to leave in/out the generated collection. A side by side comparison of the person wearing the outfit can also be posted/saved into the generated column of each liked fit in their library. When they find a piece they like, the user has a choice of liking the generated outfit and saving it to the app library on their profile. </p>
    
    <p> There is an option to make your collections public or private to be able to share their experience with their friends or connect from users around the globe based on a friending system within the app. If the profile is made public or that specific panel, then different users can search any keywords relating to clothes in any way to find inspiration from others who are like minded, and have the option to save different panels for their own use.</p>
    
    <p> Tools and Technologies: As this project will most likely be an app, a platform/software to build the app such as Appery.io, Mobile Roadie etc will be appropriate to utilize. A substantial aspect in this project will be for the app to perform object and feature detection through automated image recognition implemented into the program from the input of clothes in the uploaded photo library. As there is a need to make sense for associated keywords/imagery for the app to be able to achieve its purpose. For images with a convoluted background, the app will binarize the image to outline specific structural features to work with. Machine learning may also be a significant factor of the app as it gains more data from users’ feedback, the program will learn to execute better output. </p>
  
    <p> Skills Required: The skills needed in this project is most likely to be able to write in a few coding languages. Java would mostly be useful as applications generally use that language. Being able to design the interface is also another skill needed to present this app in an aesthetic manner that captivates users and encourages the use of it. The hardware needed is a computer for the initial code but also ios/android platforms to be able to test the app. The idea itself would be feasible however there may be complex components towards coding and implementing specific image recognition software as well as machine learning, therefore an experienced coder/developer may need to work on this project to reach the desired outcome. </p>
    
    <p> Outcome: If the project were to be successful then there’ll be people who will be appreciative and have reduced anxiety towards figuring out what to wear if that action brings stress towards their daily lives. Creating this project will also be a major accomplishment for a platform due to its complex implementations of different mechanics/code. Furthermore it’ll continue pushing the boundaries of what developers can achieve. In light of this it may also intrigue people and allow them to play around with the mechanisms of the app itself. This allows for others to be more confident and own their style through interactions with friends as well as a subliminal boost from knowing that an AI has matched it to be a perfect fit for the user. </p>
