    I’m Alisa. I was born in Russia on an island no one has ever heard of~ Sakhalin. Soon after my family immigrated to Australia to later earn citizenship. My mum named me after having a dream related to ‘Alice in Wonderland’ the day before I was born. The pronunciation of my name translates to Alice in russian and so does the spelling, but I was still named Alisa. I’m also able to speak and understand russian, but sadly not write or read. My family once again moved overseas for a few years where we traveled all around Europe, finally returning back to Australia for good. We moved houses often and funnily enough, two times on the same street. I’ve just recently graduated from high school and am currently completing a Bachelor in IT. An interesting fact about me is that I took apart an old computer just to use some parts for a small sculpture because I like art very much. I guess I’m just making up for the disrespect I caused towards a computer by immersing myself in the world of IT.</p>
