<h3>Personal Information</h3>
    
    <p style="border:2px solid Violet;">I’m Alisa. I was born in Russia on an island no one has ever heard of~ Sakhalin. Soon after my family immigrated to Australia to later earn citizenship. My mum named me after having a dream related to ‘Alice in Wonderland’ the day before I was born. The pronunciation of my name translates to Alice in russian and so does the spelling, but I was still named Alisa. I’m also able to speak and understand russian, but sadly not write or read. My family once again moved overseas for a few years where we traveled all around Europe, finally returning back to Australia for good. We moved houses often and funnily enough, two times on the same street. I’ve just recently graduated from high school and am currently completing a Bachelor in IT. An interesting fact about me is that I took apart an old computer just to use some parts for a small sculpture because I like art very much. I guess I’m just making up for the disrespect I caused towards a computer by immersing myself in the world of IT.</p>
    
    <h3>Intrest in IT</h3>
    
    <p style="border:2px solid LightPink;">I became interested in IT ever since I bought my first computer in grade 6. I was amazed at how such a small machine has been made the way it is and still curious of how everything works as much as the mysteries of life and death. I’ve always liked to go onto command prompt, change the colour to green and then type ‘tree’ to look like I was coding or hacking. During high school I also became interested in robotics as I had an opportunity to attend an IT/Engineering seminar to build it and code my own robot.

<p>I chose RMIT because it had a more hands on experience compared to other universities that focus on more academic aspects. I feel that I would be able to learn more efficiently and be able to maintain my skill in choosing RMIT. As well as the course itself, it’s located in a great environment with transport accessibility, many great people and food. The abbreviation of RMIT also contains ‘institute of technology’ in its name so that should say enough about studying IT at RMIT.</p>

<p> During my studies I expect to learn multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, SQL, html, CSS etc, enough to be able to utilise in my future jobs to a sufficient level. I also expect to learn better team work skills and even a bit of leadership throughout group projects to better be able to work efficiently as well as effectively in a team. I also hope to learn enough to be able to write some programs for the robot I assembled so it could finally function how I want it too.</p>

    <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
    <p style="border:2px solid HotPink;">The job advertisement:<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51852366?type=standard#searchRequestToken=cae8c542-63ef-4193-a81c-3224913af949">Software Developer SEEK</a> Position description and appeal: A software developer assists in creating, developing and testing software throughout the whole process. This job is appealing to me as I’m able to see the production of the whole software through and be able to manage it with my own ideas as well as the clients. I wouldn't be satisfied if I chose a job to manage a part of the production as I like to be able to complete and finalize projects /ideas. For example only being a part of the coding parts as a programmer would make me feel like I quite literally haven't ‘finished’ the job. 		 

Skills, qualifications and experience needed: The skills needed are being able to understand and program in multiple different programming languages such as Python, CSS, Java etc. 
The qualifications needed are preferably bachelor of Computer Science or any other that are relevant to the field. There usually is experience that is required to be able to get into the job of previous similar jobs working as a developer. 

Current skills, qualifications and experience needed: Currently I’m on track to completing a bachelor of IT and know basic coding of Python and html. I have no experience either as I have just started my studies in this field. 

Plan for improvement: To obtain the skills needed I need to continue studying in my field and possibly complete a bachelor of computer science if my current degree isn't enough. I also need to often practice coding during my own time to be able to improve my understanding of these languages. I may also have to apply for internships or junior positions to even qualify for some experience as it’s very difficult to gain first hand straight out of uni as companies may be more reluctant to accept freshly graduated students to be software developers for their company.
